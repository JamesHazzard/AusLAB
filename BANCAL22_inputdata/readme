This directory contains the input palaeogeotherm and adiabatic constraints used as input data in BANCAL22.

If you would like to rerun the inversion yourself, use "transfer_data.sh" (update directories to match your system)
to copy the data in the correct format into your local version of BANCAL22. 

If you prefer to just use the set of BANCAL22 output samples we generated, see "infer_LAB/data_input/BANCAL22_samples".

Dependencies:
- GNU Bash (5.0.17(1))
